  // Nevertheless, the MSVC optimizer doesn't realize that and still reduces src1 and src2 into
  // just one variable, and we can actually indirectly observe that &src1 and &src2 point to the
  // same address (THAT'S BROKEN!)
  // Some extra details:
  // - the ? operator must be there to obscure a bit that we're basically just looking at src1.bytes
  // - the src1.refcount will always be nullptr (see grpc_empty_slice_alt function)
  //   but compiler doesn't seem to be able to guess that because grpc_empty_slice_alt definition
  //   is in a different library (if we move its code locally, compiler behaves correctly)
  //

      // - build in optimized mode (in debug mode things work correctly)

      // - grpc_slice_alt implementation has to be in a different compilation unit
